				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<article>We have a large library of games. Members of our society may rent these games.
					 You may browse our library here, however, members will need to visit our library to rent a game.
					Games which you have selected may not be available at the time of your visit.</article>
					<p>
						<h2>Rules</h3>
				<li>Members can rent games for a maximum of 3 weeks.</li>
  			<li>Members can rent up to 2 games at any one time.</li>
  			<li>1-week extensions can be requested. A maximum of two 1-week extensions is permitted.</li>
				<li>Members who violate the above rules and who repeatedly do not return games
					 on time (on three occasions in a 12 month period) will be banned from renting games for 6 months.</li>
				<li>Members are expected to take good care of the games they are renting. If a game is returned damaged (e.g. a CD/DVD
					is scratched and no longer readable), the member is expected to refund the value of the game to the society and will
					not be allowed to rent games until they do so.</li>
